<abstract>
<p>Quantification and accurate assessment of the spatial variability and
distribution of soil physical and biogeochemical properties are vital
components of agri-environmental research and modeling, including
sediment source fingerprinting. Understanding the distribution of soil
properties is crucial in the development of appropriate, reliable, and
efficient sampling campaigns. This study was aimed to investigate the
spatial variability in soil geochemical and colour (i.e., spectral
reflectance) soil properties (&lt;63um) across two contrasting land
uses. The main objectives of this study are to: 1) quantify the spatial
variability of geochemical and colour properties at a field-scale (~ 40
ha) across agricultural and forested sites; 2) assess the spatial
variability and distribution of soil properties and its relation to
seven terrain attributes (e.g., catchment area, elevation). A
combination of univariate analysis and geostatistical methods were
applied to characterize the soil geochemistry and colour properties.
This information was used to both quantify and assess the variability in
soil properties. The variability and spatial autocorrelation were
generally both site and soil property specific. For a selection of soil
properties exhibiting some spatial autocorrelation, random forest
regression was used to identify the relative importance of terrain
attributes on observed patterns of soil geochemical and colour
properties. Elevation was found to explain the greatest amount of the
variation in soil properties followed by the SAGA wetness index and
relative slope position. These findings can be used to help create
efficient soil sampling designs by providing information that can inform
sampling locations and number of samples collected in order to meet
research needs and objectives.</p>

  <title>1 Introduction</title>
  <p>Variation in soil biological, chemical, and physical properties
  occurs across the landscape and in response to both regional and local
  (i.e., field-scale) variations in the five soil forming factors:
  parent material, relief or topography, biota, climate, and time.
  Superimposed on this is the influence of changes in land use and
  current and historic management practices which can further modify
  soil properties. Quantifying and understanding the patterns and
  drivers for this variation is an important component of many
  agri-environmental studies. For example, to meet the desired level of
  precision for agronomic and environmental nutrient management plans
  the spatial variability in soil nutrients will influence the soil
  sampling design in terms of number and locations of soil samples
  (<xref alt="Kariuki et al., 2009" rid="ref-kariuki2009" ref-type="bibr">Kariuki
  et al., 2009</xref>;
  <xref alt="Starr et al., 1995" rid="ref-starr1995" ref-type="bibr">Starr
  et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
  <p>Sediment source fingerprinting is a watershed-scale technique that
  is used to identify and quantify the relative proportions of sediment
  derived from unique sources. This technique uses natural occurring
  biogeochemical properties as fingerprints (i.e., tracers) to
  discriminate between potential sources of sediment and are linked to
  downstream sediment using mixing models. From a sediment
  fingerprinting perspective, investigating the spatial variability of
  soil properties at a watershed-scale can be advantageous to identify,
  classify, and distinguish between potential sources of sediment
  (<xref alt="Pulley et al., 2017" rid="ref-pulley2017" ref-type="bibr">Pulley
  et al., 2017</xref>). However, investigating spatial variability at
  smaller scales is less common
  (<xref alt="Collins et al., 2019" rid="ref-collins2019" ref-type="bibr">Collins
  et al., 2019</xref>; e.g.,
  <xref alt="Du and Walling, 2017" rid="ref-du2017" ref-type="bibr">Du
  and Walling, 2017</xref>;
  <xref alt="Luna Miño et al., 2024" rid="ref-lunamiño2024" ref-type="bibr">Luna
  Miño et al., 2024</xref>;
  <xref alt="Pulley et al., 2018" rid="ref-pulley2018" ref-type="bibr">Pulley
  et al., 2018</xref>) and remains a research priority
  (<xref alt="Collins et al., 2020" rid="ref-collins2020" ref-type="bibr">Collins
  et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
  <p>There are three main, interconnected, ways that spatial variability
  in fingerprint properties are an important aspect of sediment
  fingerprinting. First is to adequately quantify the fingerprint
  properties such that it is representative of that source. For some
  fingerprints the variability is not random but rather varies in a more
  systematic way. For example, the pattern of fallout radionuclides will
  reflect the patterns of soil erosion and deposition
  (<xref alt="Wilkinson et al., 2015" rid="ref-wilkinson2015" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson
  et al., 2015</xref>). Designing and implementing source sampling plans
  need to take this into consideration as the sampling designed used has
  been shown to influence the characterization of wide range of commonly
  used fingerprints
  (<xref alt="Luna Miño et al., 2024" rid="ref-lunamiño2024" ref-type="bibr">Luna
  Miño et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
  <p>Secondly, the issue of spatial variability of fingerprint
  properties is further complicated by overlying spatial variability in
  the rates of erosion and sediment delivery. Incorporation of both
  types of variability into the mixing model will provide a more
  reliable estimate of the proportion of sediment derived from each
  source. Many mixing models have well defined inputs (sources) and
  outputs (sediment) that are characterized by their mean and standard
  deviation and the spatial distribution or pattern of fingerprints are
  not considered. This is not ideal as the values of samples that are
  collected closer, and more hydrologically connected, to the stream
  network may in fact present a better representation of that source
  despite potentially deviating from the mean value. This issue can be
  addressed by strategic sampling where the more likely to erode areas
  are targeted for sampling. However, a considerable amount of
  information and insight is lost through that approach. There has been
  some progress using information on erosion rates to calculate a
  erosion rate-weighted mean
  (<xref alt="Du and Walling, 2017" rid="ref-du2017" ref-type="bibr">Du
  and Walling, 2017</xref>;
  <xref alt="Wilkinson et al., 2015" rid="ref-wilkinson2015" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson
  et al., 2015</xref>) and using spatially interpolated maps of
  fingerprint values to provide a finer resolution of the fingerprint
  variability within each source
  (<xref alt="Haddadchi et al., 2019" rid="ref-haddadchi2019" ref-type="bibr">Haddadchi
  et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
  <p>Lastly, understanding the geomorphic, hydrologic, and biochemical
  processes that have led to the observed patterns in spatial
  variability helps in the selection of robust and reliable fingerprints
  and/or guide the sampling design for source characterization. In
  selecting fingerprints that provide good discrimination between
  sources many studies typically used a statistical-based approach
  (<xref alt="Collins et al., 1997" rid="ref-collins1997" ref-type="bibr">Collins
  et al., 1997</xref>). However, there are concerns that this approach
  may result in the inclusion of false positives (i.e., type I error) or
  non-conservative fingerprints
  (<xref alt="Koiter et al., 2013a" rid="ref-koiter2013" ref-type="bibr">Koiter
  et al., 2013a</xref>). Consequently, there has been a call for the
  inclusion of a process-based (e.g., weathering, erosion) or
  geologic/lithologic-based explanation of the fingerprints selected to
  address these concerns
  (<xref alt="Collins et al., 2020" rid="ref-collins2020" ref-type="bibr">Collins
  et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, there is also a lack of
  standardization in how sediment source areas are sampled (e.g.,
  judgement, random, transect, grid, stratified) and it can be difficult
  to have an efficient sampling design without prior knowledge of why
  and how soil properties vary across the landscape
  (<xref alt="Luna Miño et al., 2024" rid="ref-lunamiño2024" ref-type="bibr">Luna
  Miño et al., 2024</xref>). Prior knowledge of the spatial variability
  of soil fingerprint properties would be beneficial; however, in
  practice this can be difficult, particularly with geochemical
  properties as routine lab analysis often return information on more
  than 50 elements. The spatial patterns of some soil properties are
  well studied because of their agronomic importance or ability to infer
  other important soil properties and processes and can include fallout
  radionuclides [e.g., <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>7</sup>Be; Ritchie et al.
  (<xref alt="1970" rid="ref-ritchie1970" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>)],
  plant nutrients [e.g., N, P; Vasu et al.
  (<xref alt="2017" rid="ref-vasu2017" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>)],
  soil colour [e.g., hue, value; Viscarra Rossel et al.
  (<xref alt="2006" rid="ref-viscarrarossel2006" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>)],
  major non-acid forming cations [e.g., Ca, Na; Sun et al.
  (<xref alt="2021a" rid="ref-sun2021" ref-type="bibr">2021a</xref>)].
  In contrast, the processes that control the distribution of other soil
  properties, such as rare earth elements and trace metals, are less
  well studied or tend to be site-specific, making it difficult to draw
  generalizations.</p>
  <p>Terrain attributes such as elevation, slope curvature, slope
  position, and soil wetness indices have been shown to be useful
  information in the understanding and modelling of a range of soil
  properties including soil moisture
  (<xref alt="Beaudette et al., 2013" rid="ref-beaudette2013" ref-type="bibr">Beaudette
  et al., 2013</xref>), texture
  (<xref alt="Kokulan et al., 2018" rid="ref-kokulan2018" ref-type="bibr">Kokulan
  et al., 2018</xref>), colour
  (<xref alt="Brown et al., 2004" rid="ref-brown2004" ref-type="bibr">Brown
  et al., 2004</xref>), organic matter
  (<xref alt="Zhang et al., 2012" rid="ref-zhang2012" ref-type="bibr">Zhang

  (<xref alt="Umali et al., 2012" rid="ref-umali2012" ref-type="bibr">Umali

  (<xref alt="Lima et al., 2023" rid="ref-lima2023" ref-type="bibr">Lima
  et al., 2023</xref>). Similar techniques may provide additional
  insight into the pedologic and geomorphic processes that drive the
  observed patterns of fingerprint properties within a given source.
  Since digital elevation models (DEMs) are more publicly available and
  can in some case be generated using drone imagery, while soil property
  data are often limited, terrain attributes derived from DEMs can be
  used to guide sampling design.</p>
  <p>This study builds on the previous work of Luna Miño
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-lunamiño2024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  where the impact of three different sampling designs on the
  characterization of source materials, within the framework of the
  sediment fingerprinting approach, was assessed. This study expands
  that study by using the data from grid sampling approach to assess the
  spatial autocorrelation, create soil property (i.e., fingerprint)
  maps, and identify important terrain attributes driving the observed
  patterns. The objectives of this study were (1) to investigate the
  spatial variability of a range of soil colour and geochemical
  properties in an agricultural and forested site; and (2) to assess the
  relative importance and correlation of terrain attributes with the
  spatial distribution of these soil properties.</p>

    <title>2.1 Site description</title>
    <p>Two sites of contrasting land uses located in the Wilson Creek
    Watershed (WCW), near McCreary, Manitoba, Canada were selected to
    investigate the spatial variability in fingerprint properties. The
    headwaters of the WCW are located on top of the Manitoba Escarpment
    within the boundary of Riding Mountain National Park. There is a
    ~300m drop in elevation crosses the escarpment where the streams
    become deeply incised. At the base of the escarpment is a large
    alluvial fan situated in the lacustrine deposits of glacial lake
    Aggasiz where the main stem has a meandering form. However, beyond
    the national park boundary the stream flows straight through an
    engineered drain until it reaches the Turtle river
    (<xref alt="Figure 1" rid="fig-location_map">Figure 1</xref>). Both
    sites are both hydrologicaly connected to the mainstem of the Wilson
    Creek</p>
    <p>The first site was a mixedwood forest including white and black
    spruce (Picea glauca, Picea mariana), balsam fir (Abies balsamea),
    larch (Larix laricina) and young stands of deciduous trees including
    trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides). The forested site is located
    within the boundaries of the national park where there is little
    disturbance beyond recreational hiking trails. The soils within the
    park are not well mapped but likely are part of the Grey Wooded soil
    association (Luvisol) consisting of fine sandy loam to clay loam
    soils developed on boulder till of mostly shale with some limestone,
    and granitic rocks
    (<xref alt="Ehrlich et al., 1958" rid="ref-ehrlich1958" ref-type="bibr">Ehrlich
    et al., 1958</xref>). The second site is under agricultural
    production and includes rotations of grain crops and forage. The
    site is mapped to the Edwards Soil Series (Cumulic Regosol)
    consisting of silty clay loam to silty clay soil developed on recent
    alluvial deposits

    sampling design outlined in Luna Miño
    (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-lunamiño2024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
    Briefly, at each site 49 samples were collected using a soil auger
    on a 7x7 grid at a 100m spacing. Within the forested surface soil
    samples were collected below the LFH layer to a depth of 5cm, and
    the agricultural site was sampled to a depth of 15cm to account for
    the regular mixing of the soil due to tillage and other field
    operations.</p>
    <p>Samples were dried, homogenized with a mortar and pestle, and
    sieved through a 63 𝜇m sieve to remove the sand fraction. The sand
    fraction was removed in an effort to reduce the differences in grain
    size and organic matter content between the two sites
    (<xref alt="Laceby et al., 2017" rid="ref-laceby2017" ref-type="bibr">Laceby

    geochemical element using inductively coupled plasma mass
    spectrometry (ICP-MS) following a microwave-assisted digestion with
    aqua-regia (ALS Mineral Division, North Vancouver, BC, Canada).
    Spectral measurements were made with a spectroradiometer (ASD
    FieldSpecPro Malvern Panalytical Inc Westborough MA 01581, United
    States). Spectral reflectance measurements were taken in 1 nm
    increments over the 0.4-2.5 μm wavelength range. Both samples and
    Spectralon standard (white reference) were illuminated with a white
    light source using a halogen-based lamp (12 VDC, 20 Watt). Following
    the method outlined in Boudreault et al.
    (<xref alt="2018" rid="ref-boudreault2018" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>),
    fifteen colour coefficients (R, G, B, x, y, Y, X, Z, L, a*, b*, u*,

    a composite fingerprint consisting of 10 geochemical elements (Ca,

    (a*, b*, c*, h*, and x) were identifying as providing a strong

    <p>Overall, the agricultural site had soil colour and geochemical
    properties that exhibited lower variability and more symmetrical
    data distributions as compared to the forested site
    (<xref alt="Table 1" rid="tbl-univariate-summary">Table 1</xref>).
    All 15 colour properties at both sites displayed approximately
    symmetrical distributions. At the agricultural site, all colour
    properties were characterized by low coefficients of variation (CV),
    while the forested site showed slightly greater variability, with 10
    colour properties having low CVs and five having moderate CVs.</p>
    <p>Similarly, geochemical data at the agricultural site showed lower
    variability and greater symmetry. Most elements were approximately
    symmetrical, with only nine exhibiting moderate skewness and five
    highly skewed
    (<xref alt="Table 1" rid="tbl-univariate-summary">Table 1</xref>).
    Variability was also limited, with the majority of elements having
    low CVs; 12 had moderate CVs and five had high CVs. In contrast, the
    forested site showed greater skewness and variability: seven
    elements exhibited moderate skewness, 14 were highly skewed, 28 had
    moderate CVs, six had high CVs, and two had very high CVs.</p>

    <p>The agricultural site has a relatively flat topography with an
    elevation change of approximately 3m, with the field draining toward
    a ditch in the northeast corner. The forested site has a relatively
    more complex topography, with a channel flowing from the southwest
    toward the northeast and an overall elevation difference of 18 m
    across the site. The mean plan and profile curvature measurements
    for both sites are near zero indicating an area of sediment transit
    and not accumulation or erosion
    (<xref alt="Table 2" rid="tbl-univariate2-summary">Table 2</xref>).
    The agricultural site had a higher SAGA Wetness Index but the
    forested site had a larger range in values and exhibited a higher
    degree of variability. The forested site exhibited a smaller mean
    Relative Slope Position value (streams and depressional areas) and a
    smaller Vertical Distance to Channel Network, and for both terrain
    attributes a greater variability as compared to the agricultural
    reflecting the presence of the stream crossing the forested
    site.</p>

    <p>Soil colour and geochemical composition varied across both sites.
    In the agricultural field, all 15 soil color and geochemical
    properties exhibited spatial autocorrelation with most properties
    demonstrating a strong spatial dependency
    (<xref alt="Table 3" rid="tbl-geocol-semivariogram">Table 3</xref>).
    Some of the soil properties presented a pattern that roughly matches
    (e.g., Rb, Cs) or mirrors (e.g., Ca, Sr) the overall topography of
    the site with a gradation between the highest point in the
    south-west corner towards the lowest points in the north-east
    (<xref alt="Figure 2" rid="fig-ag_map">Figure 2</xref>). Other
    properties appear to have more localized highs and low
    concentrations/values (e.g., <italic>c*, h</italic>). The
    geochemical concentrations of Ca and Rb had the largest range values
    and as result displayed a less patchy distribution across the site.
    The nugget (Co) was small for all soil properties (&lt;1.5), and Sr
    had an exceptionally large sill value (900).</p>
    <p>At the forested site, the geochemical concentrations of Fe and
    Rb, along with the color properties <italic>a*, b*, c*,</italic> and
    <italic>x</italic> showed no spatial autocorrelation and were
    excluded from further analysis and four and five properties
    exhibiting strong and moderate spatial dependency, respectively
    (<xref alt="Table 3" rid="tbl-geocol-semivariogram">Table 3</xref>).
    In comparison to the agricultural site, the soil properties at the
    forested site displayed a more moderate spatial dependency. The
    nugget (Co) was generally small for most soil properties (&lt;2)
    with the exception of La and Ni. The range values were similar
    across the different soil properties and fell between 176 and 298 m.
    Overall, the influence of the channel and floodplain environment can
    be seen in the pattern of the nine soil properties
    (<xref alt="Figure 3" rid="fig-forest_map">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

    <p>Across both sites, there was a significant (p &lt; 0.05)
    correlation between the selected soil properties and the terrain
    attributes, with the exception of the plan and profile curvature
    attributes
    (<xref alt="Table S3" rid="supptab-correlation2">Table S3</xref>).
    The elevation attribute generally had higher correlation
    coefficients; however, the direction and strength of the correlation
    did vary between both site and soil property. Overall, the random
    forest regression models exhibited relatively strong predictive
    performance, with the models better performing at the agricultural
    site compared to the forested site
    (<xref alt="Table 4" rid="tbl-rf-summary">Table 4</xref>). With the
    exception of the Ni concentration and <italic>x</italic> colour
    values at the agricultural site, elevation was consistently the
    terrain attribute that provided the greatest predictive power
    (<xref alt="Figure 4" rid="fig-rf-results">Figure 4</xref>). SAGA
    Wetness and relative slope position were generally the second and
    third most informative terrain attributes. Plan curvature was
    consistently ranked least important predictive terrain
    attribute.</p>

    <title>4.1 Variability of soil properties</title>
    <p>Variability in soil geochemical properties have been studied at a
    range of scales including continental

    and Rodríguez Martín, 2012</xref>), hillslope/catena, and farm field
    (<xref alt="Sun et al., 2021b" rid="ref-sun2021a" ref-type="bibr">Sun
    et al., 2021b</xref>). The objectives of these studies included
    addressing issues of pollution/contamination, providing
    benchmark/baseline information, investigating pedological and
    weathering properties and processes, and soil surveying and mapping
    (<xref alt="Wilson et al., 2008" rid="ref-wilson2008" ref-type="bibr">Wilson
    et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, variability in soil colour,
    typically using the Munsell colour system, is a commonly reported
    diagnostic feature used in soil classification and ranges in spatial
    scale from reconnaissance to detailed soil surveys and maps. The
    increase use of soil spectroscopy
    (<xref alt="Poppiel et al., 2022" rid="ref-poppiel2022" ref-type="bibr">Poppiel
    et al., 2022</xref>) and creation of soil spectral libraries (e.g.,
    <xref alt="“Canadian soil data portal,” 2025" rid="ref-canadian" ref-type="bibr">“Canadian
    soil data portal,” 2025</xref>) will allow researchers to also
    investigate soil colour variability using other colour space models
    (<xref alt="Viscarra Rossel et al., 2006" rid="ref-viscarrarossel2006" ref-type="bibr">Viscarra
    Rossel et al., 2006</xref>). Data distributions in soil science
    commonly exhibit a positively skewed distribution. This is likely
    due to several factors including that data of this nature are a
    semi-bounded distribution, with a lower bound of zero and no upper
    bound. Hot spots of soil processes, local variations in soil forming
    factors, and soil/land management practices can also lead to more
    extreme values (e.g.,
    <xref alt="Vidon et al., 2010" rid="ref-vidon2010" ref-type="bibr">Vidon
    et al., 2010</xref>). In many cases the cumulative effects of these
    processes, factors, and practices are multiplicative (i.e.,
    interact) and not linearly additive, resulting in a skewed data
    distribution. Lastly, the distribution of data will also be a
    product of the scale of observation, number of samples, and sampling
    design.</p>
    <p>Soil colour properties exhibited a near-normal distribution with
    a low CV which is consistent with claims that soil hue and value
    (Munsell colour system) have a low CV
    (<xref alt="Pennock et al., 2008" rid="ref-pennock2008" ref-type="bibr">Pennock
    et al., 2008</xref>). These data distribution properties are ideal
    for statistical and environmental modeling as it typically meets the
    model assumptions with out requiring transformations. For example,
    in sediment source fingerprinting, soil properties (i.e.,
    fingerprints) are considered more reliable and robust for use in
    unmixing models when they show large differences between sources and
    low variability within each source. Additionally, most mixing models
    assume fingerprint data are normally distributed. Luna Miño et al.
    (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-lunamiño2024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
    demonstrated that soil colour coefficients a*, b*, c*, h*, and x
    provided good discrimination between the agricultural and forested
    sites, and the low CV and skewness values reported in
    <xref alt="Table 1" rid="tbl-univariate-summary">Table 1</xref>
    makes these colour properties ideal fingerprints for sediment source
    apportionment.</p>
    <p>The geochemical properties were more variable and skewed as
    compared to the soil colour properties. For many trace elements,
    concentrations are strongly correlated with the proportion of
    fine-grained material (&lt;2 µm), due to its high specific surface
    area and enhanced chemical reactivity
    (<xref alt="Horowitz, 1991" rid="ref-horowitz1991" ref-type="bibr">Horowitz,
    1991</xref>). However, in this study the sand-size (&gt;63 µm)
    material was removed prior to analysis to reduce the effects of
    grain-size on concentration. This likely resulted in lower
    variability and less extreme concentrations as compared to other
    studies that focus on bulk soil samples (&lt;2 mm). In particular,
    the forested site exhibited a greater amount of variability which is
    likely due to the more complex topography and geomorphic setting.
    The floodplain within the forested site is likely accumulating
    shale-rich material derived from the Manitoba Escarpment which is
    enriched in trace metals
    (<xref alt="Nicolas and Bamburak, 2011" rid="ref-nicolas2011" ref-type="bibr">Nicolas
    and Bamburak, 2011</xref>). This creates a zone of high
    concentrations relative to upland areas
    <xref alt="Figure 3" rid="fig-forest_map">Figure 3</xref>. The
    forested site also had a higher and much more variable soil organic

    distribution, can influence the concentration of many major and
    trace elements
    (<xref alt="Horowitz, 1991" rid="ref-horowitz1991" ref-type="bibr">Horowitz,
    1991</xref>). These results provide evidence that both land use and
    landscape complexity both play a role in driving soil property

    of the spatial auto correlation between the two sites can be used to
    in designing an effect sampling campaign. The agricultural site,
    which has a more simple topography and a higher degree of spatial
    autocorrelation, the range values can be used to guide the distance
    between sampling points and a grid-style sampling regime may be an
    effective approach. In contrast, the forested site, which has a more
    complex geomorphic setting and a lower degree of spatial
    autocorrelation, a stratified sampling design may be the better
    approach. For example, at the forested site the stratas could
    include near-stream and hillslope environments. In situations where
    the soil properties of interest are not known or selected <italic>a
    priori</italic> (e.g., sediment fingerprinting) the differences in
    their spatial autocorrelation are difficult to accommodate in the
    sampling design. A sampling grid with irregular spacing, including
    spacing less than 100m, would have provided information on the
    spatial autocorrelation over shorter distances and reduced the
    uncertainty in the interpolation of soil properties
    (<xref alt="Lark and Marchant, 2018" rid="ref-lark2018" ref-type="bibr">Lark
    and Marchant, 2018</xref>).</p>
    <p>Mapping the soil properties that have a moderate to high spatial
    dependence can provide information on underlying soil forming
    processes and properties. At both sites, to some extent, the
    patterns appear to reflect the topography of the sites suggesting
    that geomorphic and hydrologic process and properties are likely
    driving the observed patterns. Identifying patterns and
    understanding the underlying process and properties that drive these
    patterns are important consideration when designing as soil sampling
    campaign to successfully meet study objectives, including
    characterizing soil properties of a field site. In a related
    context, Koiter
    (<xref alt="2013b" rid="ref-koiter2013a" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>)
    discussed the issues surrounding the use of a statistical only
    approach to selecting fingerprints and that consideration of how
    fingerprints have developed improves the robustness of the sediment
    fingerprinting approach. However, local information on the spatial
    distribution of geochemical and colour properties at field scales
    (&lt; 1 km²) is often unavailable, and the processes driving these
    patterns are also not well documented or studied. When such
    information does exist, it typically focuses on agronomically
    important properties (e.g.,
    <xref alt="Mzuku et al., 2005" rid="ref-mzuku2005" ref-type="bibr">Mzuku
    et al., 2005</xref>) or is used for soil classification (e.g.,
    <xref alt="Group, 1998" rid="ref-soilclassificationworkinggroup1998" ref-type="bibr">Group,
    1998</xref>). These datasets usually include geochemical properties
    such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulfur (S),
    calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al),
    nitrate (NO₃⁻), carbonate (CO₃²⁻), bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻), chloride
    (Cl⁻), and sulfate (SO₄²⁻). They may also include colour
    characteristics, such as Munsell hue, value, and chroma, as well as
    other soil properties like texture, organic matter content, and pH.
    The lack of information on the wide range of soil properties means
    the researchers are relying on other data, most often elevation, for
    informing sampling designs.</p>

    <title>4.3 Terrain attributes and soil properties</title>
    <p>Both the correlation analysis and random forest regression
    identified elevation as the most influential terrain attribute,
    followed by the SAGA Wetness Index and relative slope position, in
    explaining the majority of the observed variation in soil
    geochemical and colour properties. This is consitent with the
    findings of Mashalaba
    (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-mashalaba2020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)
    who also found that similar terrain attributes were important in
    predicting a range of other soil properties including texture, bulk
    density, and hydaulic conductivity. These attributes likely emerged
    as the most important factor in explaining the observed variability
    as they are strongly linked to a range of geomorphic and hydrolgic
    process and conditions [Mello et al.
    (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-mello2022" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>);
    Libohova et al.
    (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-libohova2024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)].
    For example, in eroded landscapes in the Prairie region of Canada,
    Ca concentrations have been found to be higher in upper slope
    positions from erosion and subsquent exposure of high-carbonate
    subsoil
    (<xref alt="Papiernik et al., 2005" rid="ref-papiernik2005" ref-type="bibr">Papiernik
    et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, higher Ca concentrations have
    been noted in lower slope and depressional areas due to higher
    solubility of many Ca-minerals (e.g., CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and the
    subsequent downslope transport in solution and reduced leaching
    losses in these accumulation zones. Landscape position can also have
    a strong influence on pedogenic process; for example, the
    translocation of Fe and clay down the soil profile is a diagnostic
    criteria used in classifying soils
    (<xref alt="Stonehouse and St. Arnaud, 1971" rid="ref-stonehouse1971" ref-type="bibr">Stonehouse
    and St. Arnaud, 1971</xref>). Soil colour also tends to change in a
    predictable manner in relation to local relief. Tillage and water
    erosion results in the net loss of darker organic-rich topsoil from
    upper slope positions resulting in the exposure of the lighter
    subsoil
    (<xref alt="Papiernik et al., 2005" rid="ref-papiernik2005" ref-type="bibr">Papiernik
    et al., 2005</xref>). Moisture availability is also greater in the
    lower slope and depressional areas resulting in increased organic
    matter production resulting in darker organic-rich topsoil as
    compared to the upper slope positions. There is also evidence that
    suggests that soil texture varies with elevation and slope position,
    with coarser material on upper slopes and finer material
    accumulating in lower positions
    (<xref alt="Cox et al., 2003" rid="ref-cox2003" ref-type="bibr">Cox
    et al., 2003</xref>;
    <xref alt="Kokulan et al., 2018" rid="ref-kokulan2018" ref-type="bibr">Kokulan
    et al., 2018</xref>). Given the strong correlation of organic matter
    and texture with soil geochemistry
    (<xref alt="Horowitz, 1991" rid="ref-horowitz1991" ref-type="bibr">Horowitz,
    1991</xref>) and colour
    (<xref alt="Viscarra Rossel et al., 2009" rid="ref-viscarrarossel2009" ref-type="bibr">Viscarra
    Rossel et al., 2009</xref>), these properties may also help explain
    the observed spatial patterns .</p>
    <p>The relative importance of terrain attributes in explaining soil
    property variability differs both among soil properties and between
    sites. The land use and the overall geomorphic complexity
    differences between the two study sites are likely interacting with
    terrain attributes and influencing the patterns of soil properties
    and modify the nature of terrain attribute and soil property
    relationship. This suggests that these relationships observed in
    this study may not be broadly generalizable. Similarly, information
    on how terrain attributes influence the spatial distribution of many
    trace elements and soil colour — beyond the Munsell system— at the
    field scale is limited in the scientific literature. Additional
    variables including climate and large-scale landscape features will
    also influence the observed patterns of soil properties. As a
    result, using terrain attributes to guide soil sampling or interpret
    spatial patterns of many soil properties remains challenging.</p>
    <p>The impact of sampling design at the field scale on the
    characterization of soil properties can be substantial
    (<xref alt="Luna Miño et al., 2024" rid="ref-lunamiño2024" ref-type="bibr">Luna
    Miño et al., 2024</xref>), which in turn can affect the
    interpretation of data, modeling results, and the conclusion drawn.
    High-quality LiDAR data or digital elevation models (DEMs) are
    increasingly openly available in many regions and can be used to
    create detailed terrain attribute maps. By incorporating terrain
    attributes into the sampling framework, researchers can ensure that
    key geomorphic and hydrologic gradients are adequately represented.
    Ultimately, integrating terrain analysis into sediment source
    fingerprinting is promising not only as a mechanism to improve the
    quality of source characterization but to also better link source
    material to downstream sediment.</p>

  <title>5 Conclusions</title>
  <p>Understanding the spatial variability and distribution of soil
  geochemical and colour properties at a field-scale is important for
  agricultural and environmental research, monitoring, modeling, and
  management practices. This study conducted both univariate and spatial
  analyses of a suite of soil geochemical and colour properties at two
  sites with contrasting land uses. The agricultural site, characterized
  by gently sloping topography, exhibited lower coefficients of
  variation, approximately normal data distributions, and moderate to
  strong spatial autocorrelation across most measured properties. In
  contrast, the forested site featured more geomorphologically complex
  terrain, with greater variability in soil properties, data
  distributions that more frequently deviated from normality, and fewer
  properties exhibiting spatial autocorrelation. Despite these
  differences, random forest regression consistently identified
  elevation, the SAGA Wetness Index, and relative slope position as the
  three most important terrain attributes explaining the observed
  variability.</p>
  <p>These findings underscore the role of topographic controls on many
  soil property distributions, regardless of land use. However, the
  strength and direction of the relationship between terrain attributes
  and soil property results were inconsistent between both site and soil
  property. While the study was limited to two sites, the approach
  demonstrates the value of integrating tools like random forest
  regression with spatial data to better understand soil-landscape
  relationships. Future research should expand to broader landscapes and
  incorporate additional biophysical variables to improve
  generalizability. Overall, this work highlights how terrain-driven
  spatial patterns can inform more targeted soil sampling, modeling, and
  land management strategies.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Quantification and accurate assessment of the spatial variability and
distribution of soil physical and biogeochemical properties are vital
components of agri-environmental research and modeling, including
sediment source fingerprinting. Understanding the distribution of soil
properties is crucial in the development of appropriate, reliable, and
efficient sampling campaigns. This study was aimed to investigate the
spatial variability in soil geochemical and colour (i.e., spectral
reflectance) soil properties (&lt;63um) across two contrasting land
uses. The main objectives of this study are to: 1) quantify the spatial
variability of geochemical and colour properties at a field-scale (~ 40
ha) across agricultural and forested sites; 2) assess the spatial
variability and distribution of soil properties and its relation to
seven terrain attributes (e.g., catchment area, elevation). A
combination of univariate analysis and geostatistical methods were
applied to characterize the soil geochemistry and colour properties.
This information was used to both quantify and assess the variability in
soil properties. The variability and spatial autocorrelation were
generally both site and soil property specific. For a selection of soil
properties exhibiting some spatial autocorrelation, random forest
regression was used to identify the relative importance of terrain
attributes on observed patterns of soil geochemical and colour
properties. Elevation was found to explain the greatest amount of the
variation in soil properties followed by the SAGA wetness index and
relative slope position. These findings can be used to help create
efficient soil sampling designs by providing information that can inform
sampling locations and number of samples collected in order to meet
research needs and objectives.</p>

  <title>1 Introduction</title>
  <p>Variation in soil biological, chemical, and physical properties
  occurs across the landscape and in response to both regional and local
  (i.e., field-scale) variations in the five soil forming factors:
  parent material, relief or topography, biota, climate, and time.
  Superimposed on this is the influence of changes in land use and
  current and historic management practices which can further modify
  soil properties. Quantifying and understanding the patterns and
  drivers for this variation is an important component of many
  agri-environmental studies. For example, to meet the desired level of
  precision for agronomic and environmental nutrient management plans
  the spatial variability in soil nutrients will influence the soil
  sampling design in terms of number and locations of soil samples
  (<xref alt="Kariuki et al., 2009" rid="ref-kariuki2009-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Kariuki

  et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
  <p>Sediment source fingerprinting is a watershed-scale technique that
  is used to identify and quantify the relative proportions of sediment
  derived from unique sources. This technique uses natural occurring
  biogeochemical properties as fingerprints (i.e., tracers) to
  discriminate between potential sources of sediment and are linked to
  downstream sediment using mixing models. From a sediment
  fingerprinting perspective, investigating the spatial variability of
  soil properties at a watershed-scale can be advantageous to identify,
  classify, and distinguish between potential sources of sediment
  (<xref alt="Pulley et al., 2017" rid="ref-pulley2017-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Pulley
  et al., 2017</xref>). However, investigating spatial variability at
  smaller scales is less common
  (<xref alt="Collins et al., 2019" rid="ref-collins2019-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Collins
  et al., 2019</xref>; e.g.,
  <xref alt="Du and Walling, 2017" rid="ref-du2017-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Du
  and Walling, 2017</xref>;
  <xref alt="Luna Miño et al., 2024" rid="ref-lunamiño2024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Luna
  Miño et al., 2024</xref>;
  <xref alt="Pulley et al., 2018" rid="ref-pulley2018-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Pulley
  et al., 2018</xref>) and remains a research priority
  (<xref alt="Collins et al., 2020" rid="ref-collins2020-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Collins
  et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
  <p>There are three main, interconnected, ways that spatial variability
  in fingerprint properties are an important aspect of sediment
  fingerprinting. First is to adequately quantify the fingerprint
  properties such that it is representative of that source. For some
  fingerprints the variability is not random but rather varies in a more
  systematic way. For example, the pattern of fallout radionuclides will
  reflect the patterns of soil erosion and deposition
  (<xref alt="Wilkinson et al., 2015" rid="ref-wilkinson2015-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson
  et al., 2015</xref>). Designing and implementing source sampling plans
  need to take this into consideration as the sampling designed used has
  been shown to influence the characterization of wide range of commonly
  used fingerprints
  (<xref alt="Luna Miño et al., 2024" rid="ref-lunamiño2024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Luna
  Miño et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
  <p>Secondly, the issue of spatial variability of fingerprint
  properties is further complicated by overlying spatial variability in
  the rates of erosion and sediment delivery. Incorporation of both
  types of variability into the mixing model will provide a more
  reliable estimate of the proportion of sediment derived from each
  source. Many mixing models have well defined inputs (sources) and
  outputs (sediment) that are characterized by their mean and standard
  deviation and the spatial distribution or pattern of fingerprints are
  not considered. This is not ideal as the values of samples that are
  collected closer, and more hydrologically connected, to the stream
  network may in fact present a better representation of that source
  despite potentially deviating from the mean value. This issue can be
  addressed by strategic sampling where the more likely to erode areas
  are targeted for sampling. However, a considerable amount of
  information and insight is lost through that approach. There has been
  some progress using information on erosion rates to calculate a
  erosion rate-weighted mean
  (<xref alt="Du and Walling, 2017" rid="ref-du2017-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Du
  and Walling, 2017</xref>;
  <xref alt="Wilkinson et al., 2015" rid="ref-wilkinson2015-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson
  et al., 2015</xref>) and using spatially interpolated maps of
  fingerprint values to provide a finer resolution of the fingerprint
  variability within each source
  (<xref alt="Haddadchi et al., 2019" rid="ref-haddadchi2019-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Haddadchi
  et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
  <p>Lastly, understanding the geomorphic, hydrologic, and biochemical
  processes that have led to the observed patterns in spatial
  variability helps in the selection of robust and reliable fingerprints
  and/or guide the sampling design for source characterization. In
  selecting fingerprints that provide good discrimination between
  sources many studies typically used a statistical-based approach
  (<xref alt="Collins et al., 1997" rid="ref-collins1997-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Collins
  et al., 1997</xref>). However, there are concerns that this approach
  may result in the inclusion of false positives (i.e., type I error) or
  non-conservative fingerprints
  (<xref alt="Koiter et al., 2013a" rid="ref-koiter2013-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Koiter
  et al., 2013a</xref>). Consequently, there has been a call for the
  inclusion of a process-based (e.g., weathering, erosion) or
  geologic/lithologic-based explanation of the fingerprints selected to
  address these concerns
  (<xref alt="Collins et al., 2020" rid="ref-collins2020-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Collins
  et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, there is also a lack of
  standardization in how sediment source areas are sampled (e.g.,
  judgement, random, transect, grid, stratified) and it can be difficult
  to have an efficient sampling design without prior knowledge of why
  and how soil properties vary across the landscape
  (<xref alt="Luna Miño et al., 2024" rid="ref-lunamiño2024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Luna
  Miño et al., 2024</xref>). Prior knowledge of the spatial variability
  of soil fingerprint properties would be beneficial; however, in
  practice this can be difficult, particularly with geochemical
  properties as routine lab analysis often return information on more
  than 50 elements. The spatial patterns of some soil properties are
  well studied because of their agronomic importance or ability to infer
  other important soil properties and processes and can include fallout
  radionuclides [e.g., <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>7</sup>Be; Ritchie et al.
  (<xref alt="1970" rid="ref-ritchie1970-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>)],
  plant nutrients [e.g., N, P; Vasu et al.
  (<xref alt="2017" rid="ref-vasu2017-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>)],
  soil colour [e.g., hue, value; Viscarra Rossel et al.
  (<xref alt="2006" rid="ref-viscarrarossel2006-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>)],
  major non-acid forming cations [e.g., Ca, Na; Sun et al.
  (<xref alt="2021a" rid="ref-sun2021-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2021a</xref>)].
  In contrast, the processes that control the distribution of other soil
  properties, such as rare earth elements and trace metals, are less
  well studied or tend to be site-specific, making it difficult to draw
  generalizations.</p>
  <p>Terrain attributes such as elevation, slope curvature, slope
  position, and soil wetness indices have been shown to be useful
  information in the understanding and modelling of a range of soil
  properties including soil moisture
  (<xref alt="Beaudette et al., 2013" rid="ref-beaudette2013-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Beaudette
  et al., 2013</xref>), texture
  (<xref alt="Kokulan et al., 2018" rid="ref-kokulan2018-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Kokulan
  et al., 2018</xref>), colour
  (<xref alt="Brown et al., 2004" rid="ref-brown2004-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Brown
  et al., 2004</xref>), organic matter
  (<xref alt="Zhang et al., 2012" rid="ref-zhang2012-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Zhang

  (<xref alt="Umali et al., 2012" rid="ref-umali2012-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Umali

  (<xref alt="Lima et al., 2023" rid="ref-lima2023-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Lima
  et al., 2023</xref>). Similar techniques may provide additional
  insight into the pedologic and geomorphic processes that drive the
  observed patterns of fingerprint properties within a given source.
  Since digital elevation models (DEMs) are more publicly available and
  can in some case be generated using drone imagery, while soil property
  data are often limited, terrain attributes derived from DEMs can be
  used to guide sampling design.</p>
  <p>This study builds on the previous work of Luna Miño
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-lunamiño2024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  where the impact of three different sampling designs on the
  characterization of source materials, within the framework of the
  sediment fingerprinting approach, was assessed. This study expands
  that study by using the data from grid sampling approach to assess the
  spatial autocorrelation, create soil property (i.e., fingerprint)
  maps, and identify important terrain attributes driving the observed
  patterns. The objectives of this study were (1) to investigate the
  spatial variability of a range of soil colour and geochemical
  properties in an agricultural and forested site; and (2) to assess the
  relative importance and correlation of terrain attributes with the
  spatial distribution of these soil properties.</p>

    <title>2.1 Site description</title>
    <p>Two sites of contrasting land uses located in the Wilson Creek
    Watershed (WCW), near McCreary, Manitoba, Canada were selected to
    investigate the spatial variability in fingerprint properties. The
    headwaters of the WCW are located on top of the Manitoba Escarpment
    within the boundary of Riding Mountain National Park. There is a
    ~300m drop in elevation crosses the escarpment where the streams
    become deeply incised. At the base of the escarpment is a large
    alluvial fan situated in the lacustrine deposits of glacial lake
    Aggasiz where the main stem has a meandering form. However, beyond
    the national park boundary the stream flows straight through an
    engineered drain until it reaches the Turtle river
    (<xref alt="Figure 1" rid="fig-location_map-nb-article">Figure 1</xref>). Both
    sites are both hydrologicaly connected to the mainstem of the Wilson
    Creek</p>
    <p>The first site was a mixedwood forest including white and black
    spruce (Picea glauca, Picea mariana), balsam fir (Abies balsamea),
    larch (Larix laricina) and young stands of deciduous trees including
    trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides). The forested site is located
    within the boundaries of the national park where there is little
    disturbance beyond recreational hiking trails. The soils within the
    park are not well mapped but likely are part of the Grey Wooded soil
    association (Luvisol) consisting of fine sandy loam to clay loam
    soils developed on boulder till of mostly shale with some limestone,
    and granitic rocks
    (<xref alt="Ehrlich et al., 1958" rid="ref-ehrlich1958-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Ehrlich

    production and includes rotations of grain crops and forage. The
    site is mapped to the Edwards Soil Series (Cumulic Regosol)
    consisting of silty clay loam to silty clay soil developed on recent
    alluvial deposits

    (<xref alt="Beck et al., 2018" rid="ref-beck2018-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Beck

    Briefly, at each site 49 samples were collected using a soil auger
    on a 7x7 grid at a 100m spacing. Within the forested surface soil
    samples were collected below the LFH layer to a depth of 5cm, and
    the agricultural site was sampled to a depth of 15cm to account for
    the regular mixing of the soil due to tillage and other field
    operations.</p>
    <p>Samples were dried, homogenized with a mortar and pestle, and
    sieved through a 63 𝜇m sieve to remove the sand fraction. The sand
    fraction was removed in an effort to reduce the differences in grain

    properties. The dataset was randomly split into training,
    validation, and testing datasets. Multicollinearity among the
    terrain attributed was assessed using the Variance Inflation Factor
    with a threshold of eight and correlated terrain attributes were
    removed (<monospace>usdm</monospace> v2.1.7

    <p>Overall, the agricultural site had soil colour and geochemical
    properties that exhibited lower variability and more symmetrical
    data distributions as compared to the forested site
    (<xref alt="Table 1" rid="tbl-univariate-summary-nb-article">Table 1</xref>).
    All 15 colour properties at both sites displayed approximately
    symmetrical distributions. At the agricultural site, all colour
    properties were characterized by low coefficients of variation (CV),
    while the forested site showed slightly greater variability, with 10
    colour properties having low CVs and five having moderate CVs.</p>
    <p>Similarly, geochemical data at the agricultural site showed lower
    variability and greater symmetry. Most elements were approximately
    symmetrical, with only nine exhibiting moderate skewness and five
    highly skewed
    (<xref alt="Table 1" rid="tbl-univariate-summary-nb-article">Table 1</xref>).
    Variability was also limited, with the majority of elements having
    low CVs; 12 had moderate CVs and five had high CVs. In contrast, the
    forested site showed greater skewness and variability: seven
    elements exhibited moderate skewness, 14 were highly skewed, 28 had
    moderate CVs, six had high CVs, and two had very high CVs.</p>

    <p>The agricultural site has a relatively flat topography with an
    elevation change of approximately 3m, with the field draining toward
    a ditch in the northeast corner. The forested site has a relatively
    more complex topography, with a channel flowing from the southwest
    toward the northeast and an overall elevation difference of 18 m
    across the site. The mean plan and profile curvature measurements
    for both sites are near zero indicating an area of sediment transit
    and not accumulation or erosion
    (<xref alt="Table 2" rid="tbl-univariate2-summary-nb-article">Table 2</xref>).
    The agricultural site had a higher SAGA Wetness Index but the
    forested site had a larger range in values and exhibited a higher
    degree of variability. The forested site exhibited a smaller mean
    Relative Slope Position value (streams and depressional areas) and a
    smaller Vertical Distance to Channel Network, and for both terrain
    attributes a greater variability as compared to the agricultural
    reflecting the presence of the stream crossing the forested
    site.</p>

    <p>Soil colour and geochemical composition varied across both sites.
    In the agricultural field, all 15 soil color and geochemical
    properties exhibited spatial autocorrelation with most properties
    demonstrating a strong spatial dependency
    (<xref alt="Table 3" rid="tbl-geocol-semivariogram-nb-article">Table 3</xref>).
    Some of the soil properties presented a pattern that roughly matches
    (e.g., Rb, Cs) or mirrors (e.g., Ca, Sr) the overall topography of
    the site with a gradation between the highest point in the
    south-west corner towards the lowest points in the north-east
    (<xref alt="Figure 2" rid="fig-ag_map-nb-article">Figure 2</xref>). Other
    properties appear to have more localized highs and low
    concentrations/values (e.g., <italic>c*, h</italic>). The
    geochemical concentrations of Ca and Rb had the largest range values
    and as result displayed a less patchy distribution across the site.
    The nugget (Co) was small for all soil properties (&lt;1.5), and Sr
    had an exceptionally large sill value (900).</p>
    <p>At the forested site, the geochemical concentrations of Fe and
    Rb, along with the color properties <italic>a*, b*, c*,</italic> and
    <italic>x</italic> showed no spatial autocorrelation and were
    excluded from further analysis and four and five properties
    exhibiting strong and moderate spatial dependency, respectively
    (<xref alt="Table 3" rid="tbl-geocol-semivariogram-nb-article">Table 3</xref>).
    In comparison to the agricultural site, the soil properties at the
    forested site displayed a more moderate spatial dependency. The
    nugget (Co) was generally small for most soil properties (&lt;2)
    with the exception of La and Ni. The range values were similar
    across the different soil properties and fell between 176 and 298 m.
    Overall, the influence of the channel and floodplain environment can
    be seen in the pattern of the nine soil properties
    (<xref alt="Figure 3" rid="fig-forest_map-nb-article">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

    <p>Across both sites, there was a significant (p &lt; 0.05)
    correlation between the selected soil properties and the terrain
    attributes, with the exception of the plan and profile curvature
    attributes
    (<xref alt="Table S3" rid="supptab-correlation2-nb-article">Table S3</xref>).
    The elevation attribute generally had higher correlation
    coefficients; however, the direction and strength of the correlation
    did vary between both site and soil property. Overall, the random
    forest regression models exhibited relatively strong predictive
    performance, with the models better performing at the agricultural
    site compared to the forested site
    (<xref alt="Table 4" rid="tbl-rf-summary-nb-article">Table 4</xref>). With the
    exception of the Ni concentration and <italic>x</italic> colour
    values at the agricultural site, elevation was consistently the
    terrain attribute that provided the greatest predictive power
    (<xref alt="Figure 4" rid="fig-rf-results-nb-article">Figure 4</xref>). SAGA
    Wetness and relative slope position were generally the second and
    third most informative terrain attributes. Plan curvature was
    consistently ranked least important predictive terrain
    attribute.</p>

    (<xref alt="Sun et al., 2021b" rid="ref-sun2021a-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Sun
    et al., 2021b</xref>). The objectives of these studies included
    addressing issues of pollution/contamination, providing
    benchmark/baseline information, investigating pedological and
    weathering properties and processes, and soil surveying and mapping
    (<xref alt="Wilson et al., 2008" rid="ref-wilson2008-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Wilson
    et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, variability in soil colour,
    typically using the Munsell colour system, is a commonly reported
    diagnostic feature used in soil classification and ranges in spatial
    scale from reconnaissance to detailed soil surveys and maps. The
    increase use of soil spectroscopy
    (<xref alt="Poppiel et al., 2022" rid="ref-poppiel2022-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Poppiel
    et al., 2022</xref>) and creation of soil spectral libraries (e.g.,
    <xref alt="“Canadian soil data portal,” 2025" rid="ref-canadian-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">“Canadian
    soil data portal,” 2025</xref>) will allow researchers to also
    investigate soil colour variability using other colour space models
    (<xref alt="Viscarra Rossel et al., 2006" rid="ref-viscarrarossel2006-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Viscarra
    Rossel et al., 2006</xref>). Data distributions in soil science
    commonly exhibit a positively skewed distribution. This is likely
    due to several factors including that data of this nature are a
    semi-bounded distribution, with a lower bound of zero and no upper
    bound. Hot spots of soil processes, local variations in soil forming
    factors, and soil/land management practices can also lead to more
    extreme values (e.g.,
    <xref alt="Vidon et al., 2010" rid="ref-vidon2010-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Vidon
    et al., 2010</xref>). In many cases the cumulative effects of these
    processes, factors, and practices are multiplicative (i.e.,
    interact) and not linearly additive, resulting in a skewed data
    distribution. Lastly, the distribution of data will also be a
    product of the scale of observation, number of samples, and sampling
    design.</p>
    <p>Soil colour properties exhibited a near-normal distribution with
    a low CV which is consistent with claims that soil hue and value
    (Munsell colour system) have a low CV
    (<xref alt="Pennock et al., 2008" rid="ref-pennock2008-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Pennock
    et al., 2008</xref>). These data distribution properties are ideal
    for statistical and environmental modeling as it typically meets the
    model assumptions with out requiring transformations. For example,
    in sediment source fingerprinting, soil properties (i.e.,
    fingerprints) are considered more reliable and robust for use in
    unmixing models when they show large differences between sources and
    low variability within each source. Additionally, most mixing models
    assume fingerprint data are normally distributed. Luna Miño et al.
    (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-lunamiño2024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
    demonstrated that soil colour coefficients a*, b*, c*, h*, and x
    provided good discrimination between the agricultural and forested
    sites, and the low CV and skewness values reported in
    <xref alt="Table 1" rid="tbl-univariate-summary-nb-article">Table 1</xref>
    makes these colour properties ideal fingerprints for sediment source
    apportionment.</p>
    <p>The geochemical properties were more variable and skewed as
    compared to the soil colour properties. For many trace elements,
    concentrations are strongly correlated with the proportion of
    fine-grained material (&lt;2 µm), due to its high specific surface
    area and enhanced chemical reactivity
    (<xref alt="Horowitz, 1991" rid="ref-horowitz1991-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Horowitz,
    1991</xref>). However, in this study the sand-size (&gt;63 µm)
    material was removed prior to analysis to reduce the effects of
    grain-size on concentration. This likely resulted in lower
    variability and less extreme concentrations as compared to other
    studies that focus on bulk soil samples (&lt;2 mm). In particular,
    the forested site exhibited a greater amount of variability which is
    likely due to the more complex topography and geomorphic setting.
    The floodplain within the forested site is likely accumulating
    shale-rich material derived from the Manitoba Escarpment which is
    enriched in trace metals
    (<xref alt="Nicolas and Bamburak, 2011" rid="ref-nicolas2011-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Nicolas
    and Bamburak, 2011</xref>). This creates a zone of high
    concentrations relative to upland areas

    distribution, can influence the concentration of many major and
    trace elements
    (<xref alt="Horowitz, 1991" rid="ref-horowitz1991-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Horowitz,
    1991</xref>). These results provide evidence that both land use and
    landscape complexity both play a role in driving soil property
    variability.</p>

  <sec id="spatial-distribution-nb-article">
    <title>4.2 Spatial distribution</title>
    <p>The difference in the number of soil properties and the magnitude
    of the spatial auto correlation between the two sites can be used to
    in designing an effect sampling campaign. The agricultural site,
    which has a more simple topography and a higher degree of spatial
    autocorrelation, the range values can be used to guide the distance
    between sampling points and a grid-style sampling regime may be an
    effective approach. In contrast, the forested site, which has a more
    complex geomorphic setting and a lower degree of spatial
    autocorrelation, a stratified sampling design may be the better
    approach. For example, at the forested site the stratas could
    include near-stream and hillslope environments. In situations where
    the soil properties of interest are not known or selected <italic>a
    priori</italic> (e.g., sediment fingerprinting) the differences in
    their spatial autocorrelation are difficult to accommodate in the
    sampling design. A sampling grid with irregular spacing, including
    spacing less than 100m, would have provided information on the
    spatial autocorrelation over shorter distances and reduced the
    uncertainty in the interpolation of soil properties
    (<xref alt="Lark and Marchant, 2018" rid="ref-lark2018-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Lark
    and Marchant, 2018</xref>).</p>
    <p>Mapping the soil properties that have a moderate to high spatial
    dependence can provide information on underlying soil forming
    processes and properties. At both sites, to some extent, the
    patterns appear to reflect the topography of the sites suggesting
    that geomorphic and hydrologic process and properties are likely
    driving the observed patterns. Identifying patterns and
    understanding the underlying process and properties that drive these
    patterns are important consideration when designing as soil sampling
    campaign to successfully meet study objectives, including
    characterizing soil properties of a field site. In a related
    context, Koiter
    (<xref alt="2013b" rid="ref-koiter2013a-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>)
    discussed the issues surrounding the use of a statistical only
    approach to selecting fingerprints and that consideration of how
    fingerprints have developed improves the robustness of the sediment
    fingerprinting approach. However, local information on the spatial
    distribution of geochemical and colour properties at field scales
    (&lt; 1 km²) is often unavailable, and the processes driving these
    patterns are also not well documented or studied. When such
    information does exist, it typically focuses on agronomically
    important properties (e.g.,
    <xref alt="Mzuku et al., 2005" rid="ref-mzuku2005-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Mzuku
    et al., 2005</xref>) or is used for soil classification (e.g.,
    <xref alt="Group, 1998" rid="ref-soilclassificationworkinggroup1998-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Group,
    1998</xref>). These datasets usually include geochemical properties
    such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulfur (S),
    calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al),
    nitrate (NO₃⁻), carbonate (CO₃²⁻), bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻), chloride
    (Cl⁻), and sulfate (SO₄²⁻). They may also include colour
    characteristics, such as Munsell hue, value, and chroma, as well as
    other soil properties like texture, organic matter content, and pH.
    The lack of information on the wide range of soil properties means
    the researchers are relying on other data, most often elevation, for
    informing sampling designs.</p>

  <sec id="terrain-attributes-and-soil-properties-nb-article">
    <title>4.3 Terrain attributes and soil properties</title>
    <p>Both the correlation analysis and random forest regression
    identified elevation as the most influential terrain attribute,
    followed by the SAGA Wetness Index and relative slope position, in
    explaining the majority of the observed variation in soil
    geochemical and colour properties. This is consitent with the
    findings of Mashalaba
    (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-mashalaba2020-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)
    who also found that similar terrain attributes were important in
    predicting a range of other soil properties including texture, bulk
    density, and hydaulic conductivity. These attributes likely emerged
    as the most important factor in explaining the observed variability
    as they are strongly linked to a range of geomorphic and hydrolgic
    process and conditions [Mello et al.
    (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-mello2022-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>);
    Libohova et al.
    (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-libohova2024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)].
    For example, in eroded landscapes in the Prairie region of Canada,
    Ca concentrations have been found to be higher in upper slope
    positions from erosion and subsquent exposure of high-carbonate
    subsoil
    (<xref alt="Papiernik et al., 2005" rid="ref-papiernik2005-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Papiernik
    et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, higher Ca concentrations have
    been noted in lower slope and depressional areas due to higher
    solubility of many Ca-minerals (e.g., CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and the
    subsequent downslope transport in solution and reduced leaching
    losses in these accumulation zones. Landscape position can also have
    a strong influence on pedogenic process; for example, the
    translocation of Fe and clay down the soil profile is a diagnostic
    criteria used in classifying soils
    (<xref alt="Stonehouse and St. Arnaud, 1971" rid="ref-stonehouse1971-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Stonehouse
    and St. Arnaud, 1971</xref>). Soil colour also tends to change in a
    predictable manner in relation to local relief. Tillage and water
    erosion results in the net loss of darker organic-rich topsoil from
    upper slope positions resulting in the exposure of the lighter
    subsoil
    (<xref alt="Papiernik et al., 2005" rid="ref-papiernik2005-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Papiernik
    et al., 2005</xref>). Moisture availability is also greater in the
    lower slope and depressional areas resulting in increased organic
    matter production resulting in darker organic-rich topsoil as
    compared to the upper slope positions. There is also evidence that
    suggests that soil texture varies with elevation and slope position,
    with coarser material on upper slopes and finer material
    accumulating in lower positions
    (<xref alt="Cox et al., 2003" rid="ref-cox2003-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Cox
    et al., 2003</xref>;
    <xref alt="Kokulan et al., 2018" rid="ref-kokulan2018-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Kokulan
    et al., 2018</xref>). Given the strong correlation of organic matter
    and texture with soil geochemistry
    (<xref alt="Horowitz, 1991" rid="ref-horowitz1991-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Horowitz,
    1991</xref>) and colour
    (<xref alt="Viscarra Rossel et al., 2009" rid="ref-viscarrarossel2009-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Viscarra
    Rossel et al., 2009</xref>), these properties may also help explain
    the observed spatial patterns .</p>
    <p>The relative importance of terrain attributes in explaining soil
    property variability differs both among soil properties and between
    sites. The land use and the overall geomorphic complexity
    differences between the two study sites are likely interacting with
    terrain attributes and influencing the patterns of soil properties
    and modify the nature of terrain attribute and soil property
    relationship. This suggests that these relationships observed in
    this study may not be broadly generalizable. Similarly, information
    on how terrain attributes influence the spatial distribution of many
    trace elements and soil colour — beyond the Munsell system— at the
    field scale is limited in the scientific literature. Additional
    variables including climate and large-scale landscape features will
    also influence the observed patterns of soil properties. As a
    result, using terrain attributes to guide soil sampling or interpret
    spatial patterns of many soil properties remains challenging.</p>
    <p>The impact of sampling design at the field scale on the
    characterization of soil properties can be substantial
    (<xref alt="Luna Miño et al., 2024" rid="ref-lunamiño2024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">Luna
    Miño et al., 2024</xref>), which in turn can affect the
    interpretation of data, modeling results, and the conclusion drawn.
    High-quality LiDAR data or digital elevation models (DEMs) are
    increasingly openly available in many regions and can be used to
    create detailed terrain attribute maps. By incorporating terrain
    attributes into the sampling framework, researchers can ensure that
    key geomorphic and hydrologic gradients are adequately represented.
    Ultimately, integrating terrain analysis into sediment source
    fingerprinting is promising not only as a mechanism to improve the
    quality of source characterization but to also better link source
    material to downstream sediment.</p>

  <title>5 Conclusions</title>
  <p>Understanding the spatial variability and distribution of soil
  geochemical and colour properties at a field-scale is important for
  agricultural and environmental research, monitoring, modeling, and
  management practices. This study conducted both univariate and spatial
  analyses of a suite of soil geochemical and colour properties at two
  sites with contrasting land uses. The agricultural site, characterized
  by gently sloping topography, exhibited lower coefficients of
  variation, approximately normal data distributions, and moderate to
  strong spatial autocorrelation across most measured properties. In
  contrast, the forested site featured more geomorphologically complex
  terrain, with greater variability in soil properties, data
  distributions that more frequently deviated from normality, and fewer
  properties exhibiting spatial autocorrelation. Despite these
  differences, random forest regression consistently identified
  elevation, the SAGA Wetness Index, and relative slope position as the
  three most important terrain attributes explaining the observed
  variability.</p>
  <p>These findings underscore the role of topographic controls on many
  soil property distributions, regardless of land use. However, the
  strength and direction of the relationship between terrain attributes
  and soil property results were inconsistent between both site and soil
  property. While the study was limited to two sites, the approach
  demonstrates the value of integrating tools like random forest
  regression with spatial data to better understand soil-landscape
  relationships. Future research should expand to broader landscapes and
  incorporate additional biophysical variables to improve
  generalizability. Overall, this work highlights how terrain-driven
  spatial patterns can inform more targeted soil sampling, modeling, and
  land management strategies.</p>
